## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *
  * - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *   Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * - The maxHeight property controls the rendered height of an image.
  *   Although the image here is 1200x800, maxHeight limits its rendered height to 400px.
  *   If not specified, the default maxHeight is 400px.

When walking recreationally, it is difficult to find a route that is safe, 
easily navigable, and fulfills a set of preferences–especially when exploring. 
In contrast to someone who wants an efficient route from point A to point B, 
those walking for leisure may place higher value on avoiding distracting noises 
or on walking near pleasant scenery. Existing mapping technology that supports 
walking treats walking directions like a driving route, and as such is targeted 
only towards efficient walkers–therefore, the niche of recreational walking goes 
unsupported. Because of this, many recreational walkers feel they must stick to 
routes they know; whether that exploration be small ventures from existing routes 
or fully unexplored trails, the human need for exploration is left unmet.

Our design, an app called BoredWalk, supports the niche of recreational walking 
by providing its users with unobtrusive walking directions. These directions 
guide recreational walkers along novel walking routes that match the user’s 
selected preferences. BoredWalk then utilizes the spatial audio function that 
exists in modern headphones to deliver these directions, shifting between left, 
right, or center, depending on which direction the user needs to take.

The BoredWalk app allows walkers to customize their walks by entering a set of 
terrain and walking intensity preferences, expanding walking technology beyond 
just efficiency. Following a route and providing feedback supports users in improving 
their walking experience by allowing BoredWalk to quantify the user’s rating of 
their walk. BoredWalk then uses this data to improve upon the route suggestions 
it makes to the user. The user can complete this task using only the app, or they 
can provide soft feedback by changing direction while walking to communicate to 
BoredWalk they are not enjoying their route and would like to reroute. Overall, 
completing these two tasks using BoredWalk should markedly improve the recreational 
walker’s walking experience by allowing BoredWalk to tailor its route suggestions 
to the user’s preferences and past walking experiences.

### Select a Customized Route

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: task11,
            alt: "Image of preferences screen.",
        },
        {
            src: task12,
            alt: "Image of Start Walk screen with a loop distance selected.",
        },
        {
            src: task13,
            alt: "Image of Choose Walk screen with a generated path.",
        },
        {
            src: task14,
            alt: "Image of Choose Walk screen with an alternative path.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "A walker sets their walking preferences and then chooses a time or distance. " +
        "Routes are dynamically generated which match these criteria."
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"600px"}
>

When a walker first uses the BoredWalk app, they must input their preferences 
for a set list of factors e.g. trees, hills, crosswalks, etc. The user rates 
these factors on a sliding scale, and BoredWalk utilizes these ratings to craft 
walking routes that best suit the user’s preferences. When the user would like 
to start a walk, they can either select a destination to walk to or set their 
route to be a walking loop. They then input a desired walk length–in time or 
distance–within the constraints of their desired destination. 
The user is now presented with a route that matches their preset preferences 
and their desired walk length and destination.

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: task15,
            alt: "Image showing a path selection.",
        },
        {
            src: task16,
            alt: "Image showing a walking route in progress and the \"Reroute\" button.",
        },
        {
            src: task18,
            alt: "Image showing the post-walk screen with ratings and favorite options.",
        }
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "A walker can reroute while on a walk. Favorite routes can be saved."
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"600px"}
>

The user can either start this walk or navigate forward (or backward) on the 
page to other route suggestions. BoredWalk’s route possibilities are endless! 
The user can also navigate to the home page to adjust their preferences at any 
time to better customize their suggested routes; they can also save walks to 
their favorites page if they would like to revisit this route in the future.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Follow a Route While Leaving Feedback

BoredWalk delivers directions to its user through spatial audio feedback; 
the audio balance will shift between left, right, and center based on the 
location of the user along the route and the next direction the user must take. 
Following the pre-set route is easy, but the user may become dissatisfied with 
their walk along the way. The BoredWalk app contains a reroute button that can 
be selected an unlimited number of times while the user is actively navigating 
a route. BoredWalk also offers more immersive feedback options that do not 
require the user to open the app in order to reroute. If the user disobeys one 
of BoredWalk’s audio shift directions, the app will automatically reroute. The 
user can also press an existing button on their headphones, which communicates 
to the BoredWalk app to reroute; the BoredWalk app overrides the normal 
functionality of all buttons on modern headphones. BoredWalk recognizes areas 
and route characteristics that cause the user to reroute and factors these 
findings into future walking recommendations. After a route is complete, the 
user can also rate their walk and its preference accuracy, giving BoredWalk 
quantitative feedback that can better optimize its future suggestions.

## Design Research and Key Insights

We approached the design research phase with an open mind. We wanted to speak 
with walkers from all walks of life, with the intention of figuring out why they 
walked, what issues (and non-issues) they had with their walks and how we could 
design to allay them. We had a specific interest in those who walked as a hobby 
rather than commuters. We gathered our information via interviewing a plethora 
of people, from random people on UW’s campus to friends and family. Interviews 
were our method of choice because they are time-efficient and allow us to 
interact directly with our participants, such as by asking follow-up questions 
tailored to the person. We conducted them outside, so that when the participant 
was willing, we would walk alongside them during the interview to provide an 
accurate context for the activity we were interested in.

### People dislike having to plan walks themselves

Most of the participants in our interviews typically repeated the same routes 
over and over. When asked, participants said they would like to switch things 
up and explore new areas, but did not have the time, or did not want to risk 
getting lost or ending up somewhere too busy, too hilly, or worse – too unsafe. 
This insight led us to focus on designing a way for people to explore new places 
without having to do much work planning, and without the risk of getting lost or 
ending up somewhere unpleasant.

    “I like to explore new paths [but] I am afraid of getting lost” - Andre

    “I wanna explore new places, but mostly I have little time [so] I don’t totally 
plan the route; I mostly plan the amount of time I will spend and the pace.” - Agnes


### There are no universally “good” route qualities

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: insights,
        alt: "Image portraying two walkers, one who is cool and one who loves hills",
    }}
    caption={
        "Two walkers with varying opinions"
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"600px"}
>

    Despite some general themes emerging, there were no walk qualities that 
    every participant mentioned liking. Some favored nature, some favored 
    companionship, some favored exercise, so on and so forth. This meant we 
    either had to choose a certain quality to focus on at the cost of alienating 
    some group of walkers, or we had to make our design customizable so that 
    everyone can get what they want. We went with the latter, which can be 
    directly seen in our preferences screen.


</ProjectImageBlock>
    “I don’t want to walk up any hills” - Archibald

    “I like walking up and down hills” - Alejandra

### People value immersion in their walks when possible

Many of our interview participants expressed a distaste for having to stop at 
intersections and crosswalks because it interrupts the flow of the walk. One 
interviewee, Abe, said if he could invent anything to help with his walks, he 
would have skywalks over every intersection. Another common desire was getting 
lost in nature and the world.

“I like seeing birds and squirrels…It’s nice to become one with nature.” - Andre

Participants also mentioned that disconnecting by not directly using their phone 
was important on walks. One participant, Alejandra, said she deliberately leaves 
her phone at home when going on a walk. However, a majority of walkers we 
interviewed still used headphones during their walks, whether to listen to music, 
podcasts or talk to people. All of this led us to focus on our audio-based design, 
because we believe a visual design would disrupt the walk. It also meant we had to 
come up with a way to provide information to walkers without a voice in their ear, 
since that would also be disruptive, which is why we decided upon a spatial 
audio shift for directions.


## Iterative Design and Key Insights
### Overview of Design Process:

When creating our paper prototype based off of our sketches, we made a few 
decisions to simplify some of the interfaces to make them more user friendly. 
The earliest feedback we received on this initial prototype and its associated 
task walkthrough was through an inspection process of our design according to 
Nielsen’s heuristics. After addressing and revising these violations of Nielsen’s 
heuristics, we did several usability tests with our improved paper prototype. 
After each usability test we made necessary changes to address the feedback we 
received. Once we had gone through several rounds of usability tests and iterations 
of our paper prototype we created a digital mockup of our design in Figma. 
Translating our design to be in a digital format surfaced several minor issues
as well that we addressed to ensure our design was finalized.

### State Flexibility

A key insight gained from our heuristic evaluation inspection was the lack 
of emergency exits in the “Choose Walk” screen with no way to look at previously 
generated routes and no way to leave the screen. We took this insight and applied 
it to this screen and throughout the rest of our design to vastly improve the 
transitions between states. This included making changes in our “Choose Walk” 
screen to have a “Prev”, “Next”, and “Exit” buttons as well as having more 
verbose “Save” and “Exit” buttons on the “Feedback” screen.

            src: state_flex_1,

        {
            src: state_flex_3,

        "States transitions made more flexible through addition of new buttons."
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
> 
</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Visible Functionality

Another key insight we obtained from our usability testing included hidden and 
unclear purposes of features. Our old “Start Walk” screen had a hidden loop or 
destination feature hidden behind a drop down menu that confused some participants. 
Possible reroute actions we intended for our participants to use during a walk 
were not used because there was no explanation they encountered for this. Our 
old feedback screen had a preference accuracy star rating system that confused 
some of our participants about its purpose in improving future walks. These 
issues brought up by participants led us to make several changes to our prototype 
that improved usability by making possible actions visible and their purposes more clear.

    images={[
        {
            src: vis_func_1,
            alt: "Image of \"start walk\" screen with poor functionality.",

        {
            src: vis_func_3,

        }
    ]}
    direction={"row"}

    caption={
        "Hidden functionality made more clear during revisions."
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Tutorialization and Ease of Use

When usability testing, we realized that our app was confusing to use at first 
due to various tidbits of feedback provided by participants. Specifically, many 
had issues with app navigation or did not know what to do on some screens. In 
order to improve based on this insight, we first made our app navigation a lot 
more consistent and simple by adding a back button to every screen. Then, we added 
tutorial popups to a few different features so that walkers could figure out how 
to use them when first opening those screens.
