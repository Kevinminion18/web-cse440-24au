Travelers often face challenges in turning saved travel inspiration from platforms like Instagram or TikTok 
into actual plans. Coordinating schedules, budgeting, and making group decisions for meals, accommodations, 
and activities can be overwhelming, especially considering different preferences and constraints. These
pain points often lead to conflict, inefficiency, and stress which can make traveling less fun and more 
chaotic for everyone. 

Our design transforms the travel planning process into an engaging, adventure game-like experience. It allows
users to incorporate saved destinations, collaboratively plan  detailed itineraries, and make 
decisions effortlessly. Key features include interactive budget and preference tools, group voting mechanisms,
and timely notifications of itinerary updates. By gamifying the experience and enabling equal participation,
the design ensures that planning is organized, stress-free, and enjoyable. This in return makes sure users
are satisfied and excited for their travel plans! 
</ProjectImagesBlock>


## Design Walkthrough

Like we mentioned before, planning group travel is very chaotic, with travelers struggling to turn saved 
inspiration from platforms like Instagram or TikTok into actionable plans. To address this, our design 
introduces gamification to the travel planning process, making it fun and collaborative. Through features
like group voting, budgeting tools, and real-time notifications, users can efficiently plan itineraries 
while balancing group preferences. We decided on this approach after conducting interviews with travelers 
aged 18–25 who rely on social media for travel ideas but face challenges organizing group trips. Their 
feedback inspired us to focus on two critical tasks central to an enjoyable, stress-free travel planning 
experience.

### Reducing the Pressure of Making Decisions for Activities


Our design simplifies group decision-making by using anonymous voting and mini-games. 
Users can suggest activities, such as restaurants or activities, and cast votes using tokens. 
The tokens help increase the weight of a user's vote, allowing people who feel strongly about 
an option to make a bigger impact on the decision. The goal is to make sure every voice is heard. 
When disagreements arise, users can play a mini-game to challenge the final decision. 
The mini-game is generated based on the content filled out by the user on a starting page. The page 
prompts users to input their desired activity time, location, approximate budget, and other optional 
details. Each category of information is represented by bubbles of different colors (e.g., 
time is displayed in green bubbles, while location is shown in orange). Each suggestion 
occupies a single bubble (e.g., "8 PM" is in one bubble, while "7 PM" is in another). Users can 
click on the bubbles they prefer, making them grow larger—essentially "voting" for their favorite 
plan. Ultimately, the system selects the largest bubble from each category and combines them into 
a new travel plan for further discussion. The mini-game helps create a collaborative and playful 
way to resolve conflicts related to planning. By combining voting and gamification, the app 
reduces the stress of group planning and potential conflicts, making the experience more engaging, 
fair, and inclusive.

    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>


### Making Updates to Itinerary and Informing the Group

Another feature is that our app allows users to make real-time updates to their personal 
itineraries and notify the group of any changes. When a user decides to modify their 
plans—such as skipping an activity or choosing an alternative, an automatic notification 
is sent to the group, keeping everyone up to date. This feature makes sure that all members 
are informed about others' preferences and any alterations in the schedule. Additionally, 
if one user’s change interests someone else in the group, the app allows them to update their 
own itineraries and join the new plan. This helps with flexibility because users can 
personalize their experience while maintaining group cohesion. They are able to see their group's plan
as well as their own. This is helpful as they will know which activties they are doing with their group
and which ones they are doing on their own/smaller groups. The ability to make and share itinerary 
updates in real-time makes  travel planning more organized, less stressful, and more adaptable 
to everyone’s needs.

## Design Research and Key Insights

Our design research aimed to identify key features users would appreciate 
in a travel planning app and understand their biggest pain points. To gain 
insights, we did interviews with individuals who actively use social media 
for travel inspiration because they are the ones directly affected by the challenges 
of planning group trips. We chose interviews because they allowed us to ask 
follow-up questions, delve deeper into users' preferences, and observe their 
reactions to potential features. This hands-on approach helped us determine 
which aspects of the app were most intuitive and how we could better address 
user needs.

### Collaborative Decision-Making Reduces Planning Stress & Conflict

Our design research helped us learn that collaborative decision-making tools 
significantly reduce the stress of group travel. Participants shared that the 
process of choosing activities or hotels usually feels overwhelming, especially 
when there are conflicting preferences. One participant explained mentioned they would 
find themselves compromising on things they care about "just to make everyone happy," 
and avoid arguments This feedback emphasized  the need for features that allow
each traveler to have their say while reducing social pressure. This conclusion 
allowed us to design a voting system with optional game-like features to allow users 
to challenge group decisions in a low-pressure way. This insight shaped our design 
by emphasizing a system where everyone can easily voice their opinion, making travel 
planning feel less stressful and more inclusive.

### Real-Time Updates For Itinerary Adjustments

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
         {
            src: imagePlaceholderNotification,
            alt: "UI of notification that users get when itinerary update has been made",
        },
    ]}
    caption={
        "Real time notification anytime a group member's itinerary changes."
    }
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Another key insight we found was related to the importance of real-time 
updates when adjusting itineraries. We found that the ability to easily 
change plans and notify others in real-time is really important especially 
when one person's preference diverged from the group. During our research, 
one of our participants mentioned how if someone wants to do something different 
from the rest of the group "it’s always awkward to bring it up." We figured 
if the app lets everyone know, it is less stressfull. This feedback led us 
to incorporate real-time itinerary updates, where users could update their 
plans, and others would be automatically notified. The ability for users to 
adjust their own plans while staying informed about others' decisions ensures 
that our app can allow for spontaneous changes without causing friction in the group.
</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Gamified Decision-Making Encourages Engagement

Another key insight was that the gamified aspect could work very well. We 
were able to validate that a gamified process would be the most effective 
way to engage users in decision-making and make the planning process more 
enjoyable. Participants expressed a preference for interactive elements that 
could make tedious tasks (group decision-making) feel less like a chore. 
Participants said it would be fun to compete with each other, especially for 
boring tasks like itinerary planning. This insight led us to integrate a mini-game 
feature where users could challenge group decisions with pooled tokens, making 
the process more playful. By turning decision-making into a game, we wanted to 
make sure users remained motivated and invested in the process. This also 
removed the stress of having to compromise on important travel decisions. 
This approach became an important aspect of our design because it shaped how 
we integrated interactive elements into the app to keep users engaged throughout 
the whole process.

## Iterative Design and Key Insights

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
         {
            src: imagePlaceholderPaper,
            alt: "Image of original paper prototypes",
        },
        {
            src: imagePlaceholderPaper2,
            alt: "Image of original paper prototypes"
        },
    ]}
    caption={
        "Overview of our initial paper prototype."
    }
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
Our iterative design process started with a paper prototype to figure out the main 
functionality, layout, and user flow. Having this low-fidelity design allowed us 
to quickly visualize our ideas and core features. We then had heuristic evaluations 
during class, where the evaluators identified usability issues based on usability 
principles. Some of them included user flexibility and aesthetics. After this, we 
performed usability testing with potential users. By observing how they interacted 
with the prototype, we were able to note places where they felt confused with our design. 
Based on the feedback, we iteratively refined the paper prototype to make sure we still 
focused on the pain points while improving clarity of the user flow. Once the paper 
prototype was finalized, we created a higher-fidelity digital mockup on Figma to simulate 
the final product more realistically. Overall, this iterative process helped us identify 
and resolve gaps in the design that we had overlooked at first due to our own familiarity 
with the design. The insights we came across are described later on in this section. 
But by addressing these insights, we were able to make the design more user-centric.

### More Clarity on Tokens

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imagePlaceholderHelp,
        alt: "UI of help page that answers questions users have about tokens",
    }}
    caption={
        "Help feature that answers users questions about tokens and the mini games."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

During heuristic testing, one of the users said they felt confused 
about how to use tokens for voting, how to get them, and how to navigate 
related features. This feedback highlighted a gap in user understanding 
of the voting process and the role tokens play in it. This is an issue 
as it can hurt  engagement with our design. To address this, we introduced 
a "Help" button located in our design which provides clear, concise answers 
to frequently asked questions. The updated design, tested in the digital 
mockup phase, can help users navigate the process without any other additional 
assistance. This insight emphasized the importance of accessible support features 
in reducing cognitive load and improving user confidence.

### Chat Feature for Further Discussions

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imagePlaceholderSystem,
            alt: "UI of app screen displaying button asking if users want to continue discussion even after vote has been placed.",
        },
        {
            src: imagePlaceholderChat,
            alt: "UI of chat feature allowing users to discuss decisions",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "Chat feature to allow further discussion after decision has been made."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

During usability testing, we discovered that it would be beneficial 
to discuss the results of the voting game, especially when the outcomes 
involved expensive or impractical decisions. A question that arose when 
testing was, "What if the winning option is something most people cannnot afford?." 
Initially, our paper prototype ended the experience once voting concluded, 
showing either a "You Lose" or "You Win" screen without further interaction. 
Based on this feedback, we decided to add a discussion feature in our 
design which would let participants chat about the results after the game. 
The updated design has a "I want to have a discussion" button on the final 
screen which links to a group chat where users can express concerns, suggest 
alternatives, or plan next steps. This insight was really important because 
it helped us come up with a feature that improves the inclusivity of the design 
by addressing real-world considerations beyond the voting process.

### Competitive v.s. Collaborative Game Mechanics

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imagePlaceholderLose,
            alt: "Paper prototype letting user know they lost the game by displaying 'You Lose' on the screen",
            caption: "Old design labels users as 'Losers' and 'Winners'."
                     
        },
        {
            src: imagePlaceholderResult,
            alt: "UI of app after decision has been made displaying results and showing what other users had to say about the activity proposed",
            caption: "Final prototype does not label anyone as 'Losers' in order to foster a competitive but still friendly atmosphere." 
        },
    ]}
    direction={"column"}
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Another key insight we derived was when our evaluators pointed out 
the original competitive game mechanics. Our original design declared 
a “winner” and a “loser,” which is problematic as it could potentialy 
negatively impact group dynamics and individual motivation. We realized 
this could make the voting process feel more competitive than collaborative, 
which in the long run could discourage participation. Overall, 
this feedback emphasized how competitive elements, like assigning loss 
labels, can foster resentment or disengagement which is the exact opposite 
of what our goal is for our design. To address this, we replaced the competitive 
structure with a collaborative framework. Our new version allows all participants 
to contribute their ideas and preferences without labeling anyone as a “loser.” 
By focusing on teamwork, this new design tries to remove the risk of interpersonal 
tension and instead maintains a positive group dynamic. Overall, this change aligned 
the experience of using our app with our goal of fostering more collaborative 
group dynamics.
