## Problem and Design Overview

Travelers often struggle to immerse themselves in local cultures, 
facing challenges in finding recommendations that cater to their preferences and those of their group. 
Current platforms focus on convenience but lack tools for meaningful cultural exploration.

Wanderlust aims to foster authentic cultural connections by enabling users to share and discover 
local recommendations while building meaningful relationships with locals and other fellow travelers.
Many travelers desire more than generic itineraries; they seek unique experiences that 
balance spontaneity with group needs. This app bridges the gap, offering unique recommendations 
and opportunities for social connection.

        {
            src: Homepage,

## Design Walkthrough

Our project is about improving cultural exchange by helping travelers and locals connect through shared experiences. To accomplish this, we focused on two main tasks: 
"Making New Friends While Traveling" and "Finding Locals’ Recommendations". We chose these as our tasks because they help people build meaninful connections while learning more about each other's cultures. 
By focusing on these tasks, we aim to make travel more personal and enjoyable for both tourists and locals. Additionally, these tasks encourage collaboration and trust by allowing users to 
share their own recommendations and join others' activities, creating a sense of community. "Finding Locals' Recommendations" encourages a further degree of collaboration through a 
reciprocal model of sharing a few of your own local gems to access an entire community of others.

### Making new Friends While Traveling

To support our task of "Make New Friends While Traveling", we focused on designing a feature that let people easily find and join activities with others.
<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: Connections,
            alt: "Browse join trips near you",
            caption: "Browse join trips near you"
        },
        {
            src: Make_New_Friends_Walkthrough_P3,
            alt: "Send automated join message",
            caption: "Send automated join message"
        }
    ]}
    
    width={"12"}
    maxHeight={"500px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>

 Travelers can browse trips near them, confirm their interest in joining an activity, and send automated messages to connect with the trip organizer. While participating in the activity, 
 travelers have the opportunity to talk and bond over their shared interest. 
 
 <ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: Make_New_Friends_Walkthrough_P4,
            alt: "Make social post after experience",
            caption: "Make social post after experience"
        },
        {
            src: Make_New_Friends_Walkthrough_P5,
            alt: "Social post gets added to your profile",
            caption: "Social post gets added to your profile"
        }
    ]}
    width={"12"}
    maxHeight={"500px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>

Afterwards, travelers can create social posts about their experience(s), which are added to their profile for others to see. When posting their own join trips in the
future, other travelers and locals can use these past experiences to guage if they are interested in coming along.

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: Make_New_Friends_Walkthrough_P6,
        alt: "Chat after shared activity",
    }}
    caption={
        "Chat after shared activity"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"500px"}
>

 If you had a great time during your activity, you can chat with people after your trip and continue to foster a bond by going on more join trips together or arranging
 your own plans through the chat function. Who knows, maybe you'll run into them again in some other country or they'll come visit your hometown.
 
 Interacting with other people from around the world through shared activities encourages you to participate in cultural exchanges, broadening your perspective and exposing you to 
 a global network of friends. It enriches your travel experience by creating memories that are not simply tied to the places you visit, but also the people you meet. Over time, this 
 network of friends can serve as a source of inspiration, support, and future travel plans, making your journeys around the world feel more fufilling and interconnected. 

 
</ProjectImageBlock>


### Finding Locals’ Recommendations


To support our task of "Finding Locals’ Recommendations", we designed a list and map view of interesting activities, events, and locations submitted by locals of the place you are visiting.
We categorized these as local gems because they are reccomendations endorsed by locals that you won't find through a simple internet search.

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: Finding_Local_Recommendations_P1,
            alt: "List view of local gems",
            caption: "List view of local gems",
        },
        {
            src: Finding_Local_Recommendations_P2,
            alt: "Map view of local gems",
            caption: "Map view of local gems",
        },
    ]}
    
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"500px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>

However, these reccomendations come at a cost. To facilitate the mutual exchange between locals and travelers, you are required to post two local gems from your hometown before gaining
full access to the app. Once travelers have done this, they can freely access the list and map view of every local gem on the app. In the list view, travelers can browse local gems, including places like parks, restaurants, and breweries, with brief descriptions, pricing, and accessibility details. The map 
view gives travelers a visual representation of local gems that are near to their location. 

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: Finding_Local_Recommendations_P3,
            alt: "Quick overview of local gem",
            caption: "Quick overview of local gem",
        },
        {
            src: Finding_Local_Recommendations_P4,
            alt: "More detailed info on local gem",
            caption: "More detailed info on local gem",
        },
    ]}
    
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"500px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>

Travelers can click on specific pins to view a quick overview, including ratings and reviews from locals. They can then access detailed information, such as directions
 and additional insights, like experiences shared by other travelers about the local gem.

These features emphasize the importance of building a collaborative and engaging community where travelers and locals both actively contribute and benefit. By sharing their own 
local reccomendations, travelers gain access to a broader network of suggestions, fostering a sense of mutual exchange and connection. This approach enriches our app with authentic 
unique experiences while also encouraging travelers to engage more deeply with their own communities. Being able to browse a list of high quality reccomendations at the push of a button
empowers travelers to discover hidden treasures and culturally enriching activities. This design supports authentic exploration and promotes meaningful interactions between locals and travelers, 
enhancing the overall travel experience through genuine cultural exchange.

## Design Research and Key Insights

In our design research, we aimed to understand how travelers discover unique cultural experiences and the barriers they face in finding such activities. We conducted 
semi-structured interviews and group discussions with participants, including university students, experienced solo travelers, and a group of friends who backpacked together. 
We chose these methods for their flexibility, allowing us to adapt questions to participants' experiences and gather rich qualitative insights. Having a diverse participant pool
 helped us explore varying perspectives on cultural immersion and travel planning. Our approach enabled us to identify common themes, such as the importance of social recommendations, 
 the balance between planning and spontaneity, and the role of local insights, all of which informed the focus of our design solution.

### Get Information On Activities From Locals

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: Design_Research_P1,
        alt: "Map of hidden gems nearby",
    }}
    caption={
        "Map of hidden gems nearby"
    }
    width={5}
    maxHeight={"500px"}
>
Ricky, a UW student, shared that the primary way she found out about fun and interesting cultural experiences was simply by talking to locals. A favorite memory she 
had was watching a Euro Cup game where she had been at a bar when the Netherlands won and she felt “ like a small part of the ecosystem”. Our application follows Ricky's 
insight into traveling by displaying a map of local activities that can be done nearby.

<br/>This provided insight into the importance of a dialog with locals and was important for our final design because it helped us 
categorize the types of activities that the application recommends to travelers. In our initial prototyping, our map included "touristy" reccomendations as well as local gems. However, our
design research revealed that instead of focusing on all potential activities and tourist spots that can be found in a given location, we should emphasize a focus on activities recommended 
by local people. These reccomendations have the highest chance of providing meaningful cultural experiences to travelers, and if travelers are interested in finding "touristy" reccomendations,
the internet has thousands of generic travel guides. 
</ProjectImageBlock>

### Sharing Cultural Experiences With Friends Is Essential

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: Design_Research_P2,
        alt: "Make social post after the activity is done",
    }}
    caption={
        "Make social post after the activity is done"
    }
    width={5}
    maxHeight={"500px"}
>
Participants said that they often prioritize immersing themselves in the local culture but also find significant value in sharing their cultural experiences with close friends. 
One participant highlighted that sharing these experiences deepens social bonds and offers a chance for personal reflection, leading to a greater appreciation of the knowledge 
and insights they’ve gained.

This feedback inspired us to enhance the social capabilities of our application. Travelers can create social posts after each activity, which are automatically added to their
profiles for others to view. These posts also appear on their friends’ feeds, sparking conversations about past cultural activities and creating opportunities for deeper connections. 
This feature not only allows travelers to document their journeys but also encourages the exchange of cultural experiences within their network.

By integrating these social features, our application fosters a thriving community of interconnected travelers who inspire and encourage one another to explore the world and 
engage in cultural exchanges. These shared experiences create meaningful connections, broaden perspectives, and promote a sense of global unity, helping travelers build lasting 
relationships and a deeper appreciation for diverse cultures.
</ProjectImageBlock>

### Spontaneity and Flexibility Are Key Elements in Travel Planning

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: Connections,
        alt: "Browse for nearby activities and join them",
    }}
    caption={
        "Browse for nearby activities and join them"
    }
    width={5}
    maxHeight={"500px"}
>
While participants generally prefer to plan major activities in advance, they highly value the ability to adapt and take advantage of new opportunities as they arise. 
One participant described using tools like Google Maps to trop pins, allowing them to easily explore nearby activities on the spot. This helped them navigate efficiently while
also providing the freedom to pivot if something was more intriguing or they were unable to complete their original plan.Participants emphasized prioritizing unique, unplanned experiences, 
which were often the most memorable moments of their trips.  

Because of this emphasis on spontaneity and flexibility in our desing research, we designed the backbone of our application around this. These features allow travelers to discover and 
join nearby activities easily, enabling them to take advantage of impromptu opportunities. Travelers can also host their own activities, fostering connections with others who share similar interests. 
Additionally, our design includes tools for finding hidden local gems, allowing travelers to dive deeper into authentic, off-the-beaten-path experiences.

By integrating these features, our application not only supports the structured aspects of travel planning but also embraces the unexpected, making it easy for users
to create meaningful and memorable experiences on the go. This combination of planned and spontaneous exploration enhances the overall travel experience, fostering a sense of 
adventure and discovery while maintaining the flexibility to adapt on the go based on your needs.

## Iterative Design and Key Insights

The iterative design process for Wanderlust involved multiple phases of refinement, 
beginning with paper prototyping, progressing through heuristic evaluations and 
usability testing, and creating our final design. Paper prototypes 
were used to sketch out workflows and interface layouts, focusing on the core tasks of 
"Finding Locals' Recommendations" and "Making New Friends While Traveling." 
These low-fidelity prototypes allowed us to explore ideas quickly and 
make adjustments based on initial evaluations.

Heuristic evaluations identified usability issues such as missing back buttons, unclear 
navigation flows, and redundant elements. These issues helped us make revisions to ensure 
the design aligned with user expectations and provided intuitive interaction paths. 
We conducted usability testing, highlighting challenges in navigation, task visibility, 
and users’ mental models of the app's features. We tested with diverse participants which helped
emphasized the need for structural revisions, such as reorganizing menus and simplifying 
user flows. The transition to digital mockups offered a more realistic testing environment, 
which helped iterate on the interface and functionality based on feedback.

### Intuitive Navigation Matters
<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: mapBefore,
            alt: "Paper prototype map",
        },
        {
            src: moreInfoBefore,
            alt: "Paper prototype more info",
        },
    ]}
    caption={
        "Paper prototype screens without back buttons for emergency exits"
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"350px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>
Throughout our testing, users frequently encountered difficulties navigating between pages due to the 
absence of back buttons and a lack of clear pathways to exit or return to previous states. 
These challenges were flagged during usability testing and heuristic evaluations, 
emphasizing violations of the "User Control and Freedom" heuristic. 

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[{
            src: Finding_Local_Recommendations_P3,
            alt: "More info",
            caption: "Exit button",
        },
        {
            src: Make_New_Friends_Walkthrough_P2,
            alt: "Join request conformation screen",
            caption: "Conformation and cancel buttons",
        },
        {
            src: creatJoinPost,
            alt: "Create new join request",
            caption: "Back button",
        },
        
    ]}
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"350px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>

To address this issue, we implemented structured navigation elements, including back buttons and cancel options,
ensuring users could move seamlessly between sections without confusion. This improvement 
created a more intuitive experience, empowering users to explore the app effortlessly while 
enhancing their overall satisfaction with the interface.



### Locals’ Engagement Is Key

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: mapBefore,
            alt: "Paper prototype map",
        },
        {
            src: feedBefore,
            alt: "Paper prototype feed",
        },
    ]}
    caption={
        "No incentive for locals to share their reccomendations"
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"350px"}
>

</ProjectImagesBlock>
After our initial testing, it was clear that locals were hesitant to contribute their recommendations, 
often feeling that the effort lacked immediate personal benefit. 

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: Design_Research_P1,
            alt: "Final design map of local gems",
        },
        {
            src: Finding_Local_Recommendations_P1,
            alt: "Final design list of local gems",
        },
    ]}
   
    caption={
        "Features locked until travelers submit two of their own local gems"
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"500px"}
>

</ProjectImagesBlock>

To address this barrier,
we introduced a reciprocal model requiring users to share their own recommendations 
before accessing the full database. Limited previews of other users’ contributions were 
also added to showcase the app’s value and encourage participation. These changes helped 
establish a sense of mutual exchange, fostering a stronger community of engaged users 
willing to share their unique cultural insights.


### Task Clarity Improves Usability

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: feedBefore,
            alt: "Paper Prototype feed",
        },
        {
            src: connectionsBefore,
            alt: "Paper prototype connections",
        },
    ]}
   
    caption={
        "Feed and connections with mixed functionality"
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"500px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>

Participants struggled to locate features such as joining activities or posting recommendations, which limited their ability to fully engage 
with the app’s capabilities. Usability testing highlighted the need for clearer feature discoverability and a more intuitive mental model for
 navigating throughout the app. 
<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[{
            src: Connections,
            alt: "Final design connections",
        },
        {
            src: Finding_Local_Recommendations_P1,
            alt: "List view of local gems",
        },
    ]}
    caption={
        "Functionality separated into each individual tab"
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"500px"}
>
</ProjectImagesBlock>

To address this, we redesigned menus and included contextual prompts to guide users. For example, join 
buttons were made to be more prominent on activity feeds, and key functions were highlighted to reduce user confusion. These adjustments ensure
that users can easily access and utilize the app's most important features.
