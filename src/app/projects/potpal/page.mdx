Traditional journaling is a powerful tool for self-reflection, but it can be difficult to
consistently stick with since it requires a lot of thinking, creating resistance and discouraging
individuals from regularly reflecting.

With fast-paced and busy schedules, people often find themselves struggling to find time to connect
with their emotions and reflect on their thoughts. Taking even a few minutes to sit down and
journal can be overwhelming and too much of a commitment, especially when balancing personal
responsibilities. This detachment can lead to missed opportunities for reflection, impacting an
individual's mental well-being.

Our design, Pot Pal, aims to integrate reflection into our everyday routines. Instead of
individuals planning dedicated time for reflection, our solution makes the process easier through 
simultaneous verbal recording of conversations and caring for a plant. Through conversations
about emotions, moments, and thoughts, users can naturally reflect without the burden of setting
aside time to write and think out a structured entry. With these conversations recorded in a
companion app, users can also revisit memories for future deeper reflections.


## Design Walkthrough

Our design focuses on integrating emotional reflection and caring for a plant—a task part of
our everyday lives, addressing the challenge of finding dedicated time for reflection. Revolving
around a smart plant pot and a companion mobile app, individuals can speak to the plant with these
conversations recorded in the app. The pot and app work together to provide users with opportunities
for future reflection and immediate emotional processing.

### Future Reflection


When users talk with the smart pot, these conversations are recorded and stored for
revisiting. Future reflections allow users to look back on past emotions and memories,
helping them identify emotional and mental well-being patterns. They can see their journey
documented in how they have changed, better understand triggers, or see how certain factors may
impact their well-being.

### Process and Debrief Active Emotions

As individuals care for their plants, they can focus on processing and talking about their emotions
in real-time. These conversations can provide immediate relief and an outlet for users to express
their feelings, helping them avoid suppressing their emotions. By regularly debriefing their active
emotions, users can improve their emotional regulation, build resilience and good habits, and be
grounded in the present.

## Design Research and Key Insights

Our design research was focused on learning about what made current and previous journalers want
to journal and why previous journalers had stopped journaling. We wanted to learn about what
pain points there are in currently existing journaling products so that we can better improve the
user's experience. By learning about what the users’ want out of journaling, we can better design
a product that satisfies their goal.

To conduct our research, we decided on doing 1:1 conversational interviews with our participants.
Our participants in this research were people who once journaled but have since stopped, or those
who never got into the habit of journaling. Through this type of interview, we were able to conduct
a casual conversation with the participants as they share their personal journaling experiences with
us. Due to the private nature of journaling, we found that a 1:1 conversational interview was
well-suited as it kept our conversation private and we were able to really let the participants
lead and share their experiences.


### Self-reflection is Difficult

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: designResearch2,
            alt: "Initial design sketch of Pot Pal synthesizing previous information and " +
            "displaying it on its screen as well as talking about it.",
            caption: "Pot Pal displaying synthesized reflections on its screen and talking about it."
        },
    ]}
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

From our design research, one key insight that came up was that people tend to have a hard time
rereading what they’ve written. One participant had mentioned that they failed to reflect despite
having initially begun journaling with the goal of reflecting. The reason why they disliked it was
because they found their own writing difficult and embarrassing to read back on. From this insight,
we decided that no matter what modality we have for users to record their entries, we want to
synthesize it such that the user will feel more comfortable rereading or relistening to their entry.
This resulted in Pot Pal’s listening, recording, and synthesis process before saving it to memory.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Other Modalities

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: designResearch1,
            alt: "Initial design sketch of Pot Pal listening to user and visually showing it " +
            "by displaying an ear on its screen. Also sketches of PotPal talking.",
            caption: "Initial sketches of Pot Pal listening to user and speaking.",
        },
    ]}
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

One participant mentioned that they disliked typing into their phone to record their entry. They
found that it was difficult to type fast and type everything they wanted down consistently. Another
participant mentioned that one of the contributing factors to why they’ve stopped journaling was
due to a hand injury. From these participants’ experiences, we began considering speech as one of
our recording modalities. In our final design, Pot Pal listens to the user as they speak and
records their entry in a companion app. The companion app also allows users to type in entries as
an alternative recording modality.


</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Documenting and Reflecting

Participants generally viewed journaling as a way to record memories as well as thoughts to look
back on in the future to gain insights from. One participant enjoyed journaling during their study
abroad trip to record memories and another wanted to look back on their entries to learn about
themselves. From this insight, we wanted our product to allow those kinds of reflections to happen
and not just have users share their memories and experiences to never interact with them again.
This led us to, at minimum, wanting a way to store and display previous entries. This ended up
being our “All Entries” view in our companion app where users can go and view all of their previous
entries. At the same time, we also wanted to integrate those memories and experiences more and
this led to our idea of making our product be able to recall and retrieve information from entries
to better support the user.


## Iterative Design and Key Insights

Our iterative design process focused on understanding how we could provide users with more freedom
and ensure that our design was easy to navigate. The goal was to refine the smart pot and app’s
usability and user autonomy when interacting with them. Our initial paper prototype consisted of a
simple paper pot, designed to explore how we could blend a plant with user-spoken input. We
included a companion app, but there were many overlooked features we discovered during testing.
Through usability testing, we identified areas of improvement, such as the lack of user control
and cluttered app design. Participants were hesitant to speak to the plant pot since there wasn’t
an existing activation phrase or indicator that they could even speak to it at all. In the app,
users felt like their stored memories in a tree format were disorganized and difficult to navigate.
There was also a desire to delete and add entries and customize dynamic personalities. Using these
insights, we created a digital mockup that allows for more user control and intuitive design.

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: paperPrototype,
        alt: "Paper prototype of Pot Pal including its paper screens to prototype the app and " +
        "a paper pot with sticky notes to prototype the different faces of Pot Pal.",
    }}
    caption={
        "We prototyped both the pot, as well as the companion app."
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
</ProjectImageBlock>

### Activation Phrase and Visual Speaking Cue

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: phraseCue,
        alt: "A before and after comparison of Pot Pal. In the before, Pot Pal did not visually " +
        " cue what its activation phrase is but in the after it does.",
    }}
    caption={
        "Pot Pal before did not cue users on its activation phrase which was modified to do so " +
        "in the after."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Initially, Pot Pal’s idle state was just its smiling face. Through our usability tests, we realized
that Participant 2 was hesitant to talk to the plant. They didn’t know how to engage with it. When
they realized that they were supposed to talk to the plant, they weren’t sure what to say to
activate the plant.

In response, we decided to implement two changes. On the pot, we added a microphone indicator on
the screen to indicate when it is on and off. To complement this, we came up with a term
“Hi Pot Pal” so users can turn on the plant through an activation line. In the app, we will teach
the user to activate the pot by saying “Hi, Potpal!”

### Recommended Water Amount

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: waterAmount1,
            alt: "The home page of Pot Pal's app where Pot Pal is very thirsty."
        },
        {
            src: potWatering,
            alt: "Pot Pal is getting watered and its screen " +
            "is slowly filling up with water, indicating that it is being watered as well as " +
            "being an indicator to tell user when to stop watering."
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "As you water a thirsty Pot Pal, the face of Pot Pal fills up with water until Pot Pal" +
        "receives enough water."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Although all of our participants were aware of how to water a plant and that plants needed to be
watered, we observed a participant who said that they didn’t know how much to water the plant and that other users
may feel the same. There were worries about accidentally drowning the plant or not watering the
plant enough, resulting in the plant’s death.

In response to this feedback, we decided to implement a recommended water amount.
With in-built water and weight sensors, Pot Pal can detect how much water is added to it,
allowing users to safely add water without needing to explicitly know how much.

On its face, the water level rises, until Pot Pal is all watered. Then, it shows the user a
“Watering Completed” screen, before going back to Pot Pals face view.


</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Allowing User Customization

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: customization1,
            alt: "A paper prototype sketch of the home page of Pot Pal's app where the profile " +
            "button in the top right corner is highlighted.",
        },
        {
            src: customization2,
            alt: "Pot Pal's setting page where you can modify settings about you and the app " +
            "and also customize Pot Pal's settings.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "Pot Pal app's profile screen where users can adjust app settings and their Pot Pal's " +
        "settings when they previously could not."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

When participants clicked on the profile icon, we didn’t have a profile screen ready.
We realized that we needed to implement a profile screen and think about what key information
should be shown here.

Based on this feedback, we implemented a profile screen with information we thought would be
helpful to the user and allow further customization to both the app and the pot. In particular,
this page will allow people to rename PotPal, add additional PotPals, sync PotPal with their
contacts, location, and photos, and increased accessibility options
(like showing captions on the pot).
